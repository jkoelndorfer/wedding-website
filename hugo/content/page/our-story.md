Meeting
-------

{{< names-inline >}} first met as seventh graders at Wilson Middle School
in 2001. While John had a *huge* crush on Val, there was no romance in
their younger years. They went separate ways in high school.

In a happy accident, John spotted Val on the University of Minnesota campus
across Washington Avenue, just in front of the [Coffman Memorial Union](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qpzkRzZXdfqqgGHL9).
John reached out to Val on Facebook to say hello. {{< names-inline >}}
kept in touch and eventually, John got the romance he yearned for
so many years prior.

Today
-----

{{< names-inline >}} live in Minnetonka, Minnesota with Val's lovely children,
Janiah and Noah, and their three cats: Darla, Rosie, and Ruby.
