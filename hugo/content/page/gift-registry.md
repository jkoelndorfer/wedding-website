Your presence at our wedding is the best gift we could ask for. We do not
have a gift registry and kindly request that you *do not* bring gifts to
our wedding ceremony or reception. We are hoping to avoid wrangling
a pile of gifts on an already busy day.

We would appreciate a card with a personal message, if you would like
to bring one.
